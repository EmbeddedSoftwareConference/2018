											<h2>Welcome to ICESS 2018</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Embedded software and systems are closely related to our daily life and reside from smart appliances to unmanned trains. As the fastest growing industry, embedded systems will have great societal and environmental impacts. Therefore, the design and implementation of safe and efficient embedded software and systems are of utmost importance.</p>

<p>ICESS 2018 is the 15th IEEE International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems. It provides an international forum for presenting and discussing emerging ideas and trends in embedded software and systems from both the research community as well as the industry. ICESS 2018 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC).</p>

<p>ICESS 2018 is the next event in a series of highly successful international conferences on embedded software and systems (ESS), held in recent years as ICESS 2017 (Sydney, Australia, August 2017), ICESS 2016 (Sichuan, China, August 2016), ICESS 2015 (New York, USA, August 2015), ICESS 2014 (Paris, France, August 2014), ICESS 2013 (Sydney, Australia, December 2013), ICESS 2012 (Liverpool, England, UK, June 2012), ICESS 2011 (Changsha, China, November 2011), ICESS 2010 (Bradford, UK, July 2010), and ICESS 2009 (Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, May 2009).</p>

<p>The accepted papers from this conference will be published by IEEE Computer Society in IEEE proceedings (indexed by EI Compendex). Distinguished papers, after further revisions, will be considered for possible publication in several SCI & EI indexed special issues of prestigious international journals.</p>

									<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
									<p>The IEEE International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems brings together researchers and developers from academia, industry, and government to advance the science, engineering, and technology of embedded software development. ICESS is becoming an important venue for research in the design and analysis of software that interacts with physical processes, with a long-standing tradition for results on cyber-physical systems, which compose computation, networking, and physical dynamics.</p>
